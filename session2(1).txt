In the previous slide, you saw both === and == returned false while comparing equality of a and b. So, what’s the difference between them?

==

Loose equality i.e. checks only on the basis of values, not types.


===

Strong equality i.e. checks on the basis of values as well as types.


Function - to reuse code

Non-Parametric:
function greet() {
    console.log( “Hi” );
}

Parametric:
function add( x, y ) {            ->    x & y are parameters
    return x + y;                 ->    To return the result value
}

Parametric functions are called with arguments, ex.:   	add( 5, 2 ) ;
