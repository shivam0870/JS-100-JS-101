A function is defined using the function keyword
This is followed by the name of the function followed by the round brackets to pass parameters
The body of function is written within {}

Naming conventions for function name-

Function names are generally written like this: getName, show_message.
Spaces are not allowed in function names.
Try to use only letters, digits and underscore, avoid special characters
Keywords cannot be used to name functions.
Choose a meaningful name for the function which clearly tells us what the function will do and avoid generic names (like x, y, tmp)
Don’t make your names too long


Function Parameters- 

Non Parameterized Function
function sayHello(){
	console.log(“Hello everyone”);
}

Parameterized Function

function sum(num1, num2){

var sum = num1+num2;
	console.log (“Sum is “ + sum);

}

Debrief: Parameters vs. Arguments

A parameter is a variable you create in  a function when you define it.
An argument is the value that you pass to the function when you call it.

Advantages of Functions:

Reduces the size of code
Functions makes a program more readable
Reusability of code
Makes implementation and debugging much easier


The “return” keyword allows a function to return a value back to where the function is being “called”

function fun(){
    var temp = "My name is Shivam Kumar Singh";
    console.log(temp);
}
fun();
console.log(temp); //Function Scope -  the variables are only accessible in the function in which they are declared
hence this will throw an error

Types of functions

Inbuilt functions
A function that already exists in the language without you having to define it.
Collection of such functions is called a library. Each library serves a particular purpose.
Every programming language provides a number of inbuilt libraries.

User defined functions
A function that you define in your code to implement a specific task.
