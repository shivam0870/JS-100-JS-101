Keyword    Allows re-declaration   Allows re-asssignment 
var         Yes                         Yes
let        No                           Yes
const         No                      No


Now re-declare a new variable using let 

let greeting = "say Hi";
console.log(greeting) 
let greeting = "say Hello";
console.log(greeting) 

//Syntax error

Summary: 
Values are stored in the memory, and variables are the labels pointing to the memory address where the value is stored. 
When we assign a value to a variable either directly (e.g. b = 20;) or from one variable to another 
(e.g. b = a;), a new copy of that value is created and stored in the memory and the variable points to it.
