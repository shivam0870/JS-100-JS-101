While Loop (Condition-based loop)
Repeat = Loop.
Repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. 
A "while" loop is a condition-based loop.

A While Loop is used to implement Conditional Loop in Programming

The While Loop is used to repeat a block of code as many times as the condition remains true.

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

//For loop  example:

for (initialization ;  condition ; updation)

{
	
}


Sequence 
Sequence is a series of instructions to be carried out in succession i.e. one after the other.
Selection
Executing a block of code only when a certain condition is true.
Iteration
Repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. 

Sometimes, we need to combine all of them in once to achieve a task.
